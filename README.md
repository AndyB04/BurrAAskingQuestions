Peer reviewed by Amardeep Mann: Good call on the while loop for the play-again functionality. Worked like a charm! Interesting take to break up the responses into two separate outputs- it worked well and was unique. Make sure to stick with "best practice" variable names next time. "Morning" and "Breakfast" should have probably been lower case and "playagain" should have probably been camel cased but I'm nitpicking here. In a future revision also maybe account for the user typing in "No" and "NO" just in case they're bad at following instructions. All in all great work!
